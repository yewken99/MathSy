# 📖 Project Overview

Mathematics is an important subject in the Malaysian SPM examination, but students often face difficulties identifying their weaknesses, understanding complex questions, and receiving personalized guidance outside the classroom.

Traditional learning platforms generally provide the same exercises and resources to every student.

**MathSy aims to address this limitation by adapting the learning experience to each individual student.**

The platform integrates multiple AI and machine learning components to:

* 📷 Process mathematics questions
* 🤖 Provide AI-powered mathematical tutoring
* 🧮 Generate step-by-step mathematical solutions
* ✍️ Check students' mathematical working
* 📚 Retrieve relevant SPM questions and marking schemes
* 🧠 Predict student performance
* 📊 Analyze study patterns
* 🎯 Recommend topics for improvement
* 🔄 Adapt practice based on student mastery
* 📝 Generate targeted review questions
* 📈 Track student learning progress

# ✨ Main Features

## 1. 📷 Quick Snap AI

Quick Snap allows students to upload an image of a mathematics question.

The system analyzes the question and provides two learning modes.

### Generate Solution

The system:

```text

      ↓
Question Understanding
      ↓
Topic Identification
      ↓
RAG Retrieval
      ↓
Mathematical Solver
      ↓
LLM Explanation
      ↓
Verified Solution
```

The generated solution provides a structured, step-by-step explanation designed for SPM students.

### Check My Work

Students can submit their own working and receive feedback on their solution.

The system analyzes the student's approach and compares it against the expected solution and relevant marking scheme.

This allows students to understand:

* Where they made mistakes
* Which step was incorrect
* Why the mistake occurred
* How the solution should be approached

---

# 2. 🤖 AI Mathematics Tutor

MathSy includes an AI-powered mathematics chatbot designed to act as a virtual mathematics tutor.

The chatbot supports students by providing:

* Step-by-step explanations
* Concept explanations
* Follow-up questions
* Hints and guidance
* Error clarification
* Mathematical problem solving
* English and Bahasa Melayu explanations

Instead of simply returning an answer, the tutor is designed to help students understand the reasoning behind the solution.

---

# 3. 🔎 Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

MathSy uses **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** to ground AI-generated responses in SPM-specific learning materials.

Relevant SPM questions and marking schemes are stored and indexed for retrieval.

### RAG Architecture

```text

                       ▼
               Final Explanation
```

The RAG component helps ensure that generated responses remain relevant to the **SPM Mathematics syllabus and marking expectations**.

---

# 4. 🧮 Mathematical Solver & Verification

Large Language Models are not always reliable at mathematical calculations.

MathSy therefore uses a hybrid approach combining LLM reasoning with deterministic mathematical tools.

The system can route problems to specialized mathematical solving logic such as:

* Algebra
* Equations
* Geometry
* Trigonometry
* Statistics
* Probability
* Taxation
* Matrices

Mathematical calculations can be verified using:

* **SymPy**
* Custom Python mathematical logic
* Rule-based validation

### Hybrid Reasoning

```text
                Mathematics Question
                         │
                         ▼

                                        ▼
                                      SymPy
                                        │
          └──────────────┬──────────────┘
                         ▼
                    Verification

                         ▼
                 Final AI Response
```

This architecture reduces dependency on the LLM for numerical calculations while preserving its ability to generate natural-language explanations.

---

# 5. 🧠 Machine Learning System

MathSy also includes a dedicated **Machine Learning component** for analyzing student learning behavior and providing personalized insights.

The machine learning component consists of three main models:

```text
                    Student Data
                         │
          ┌──────────────┼──────────────┐
          │              │              │
          ▼              ▼              ▼

          │              │              │
          └──────────────┼──────────────┘
                         ▼
                Student Learning Profile
                         │
                         ▼
                Personalized Experience
```

---

## 5.1 📈 Grade Prediction Model

The Grade Prediction Model estimates a student's potential mathematics performance based on their historical learning and assessment data.

Possible input features include:

* Previous test scores
* Question accuracy
* Practice frequency
* Topic performance
* Number of attempts
* Learning activity
* Historical assessment results

The model provides an estimated performance outcome that can help identify students who may require additional support.

### Example Workflow

```text
Student Performance Data
          ↓
Feature Processing
          ↓
Machine Learning Model
          ↓
Predicted Performance
          ↓
Student Dashboard
```

---

# 5.2 📊 Study Pattern Analyzer

The Study Pattern Analyzer analyzes how students interact with the platform.

It can examine patterns such as:

* Study frequency
* Study duration
* Practice frequency
* Question attempts
* Accuracy
* Topic engagement
* Performance trends

The objective is to identify meaningful learning behaviors and provide insights into how the student studies.

### Example

```text
Student Activity
       ↓
Data Collection
       ↓
Feature Extraction
       ↓
Pattern Analysis
       ↓
Learning Behaviour Insights
```

---

# 5.3 🎯 Topic Recommender

The Topic Recommender identifies mathematics topics that students should focus on based on their historical performance.

The recommendation system considers factors such as:

* Topic accuracy
* Recent performance
* Question difficulty
* Attempt history
* Student mastery
* Weak-topic identification

### Recommendation Flow

```text
Student Performance
        ↓
Topic Performance Analysis
        ↓
Identify Weak Topics
        ↓
Recommendation Model
        ↓
Recommended Topics
        ↓
Personalized Practice
```

The objective is to avoid giving every student the same practice questions.

---

# 6. 🎯 Adaptive Learning

MathSy incorporates an **ELO-inspired rating system** to estimate student mastery and question difficulty.

The system maintains ratings for both:

```text
Student Mastery
       +
Question Difficulty
       ↓
Performance Update
       ↓
Updated Mastery
       ↓
Future Question Selection
```

As students answer questions, their estimated mastery can change according to their performance.

This enables the platform to provide progressively more appropriate practice questions.

---

# 7. 📝 Targeted Review Generation

When a student struggles with a question, MathSy can generate a targeted review question based on the original problem.

The generated question attempts to preserve:

* Mathematical concept
* Topic
* Difficulty
* SPM-style structure

while changing the question values or context.

### Example

```text
Student gets Question Wrong
            ↓
       Identify Topic
            ↓
      Analyze Difficulty
            ↓
     Generate Variant
            ↓
       New Question
            ↓
      Student Practices
            ↓
      Update Mastery
```

This creates a continuous learning cycle rather than treating each question as an isolated activity.

---

# 8. 📊 Student Dashboard & Learning Analytics

MathSy provides students with an overview of their learning progress.

The dashboard can present information such as:

* Overall performance
* Mathematics accuracy
* Topic performance
* Weak areas
* Recommended topics
* Learning trends
* Study patterns
* Predicted performance
* Practice history

The goal is to help students understand **how they are progressing and where they should improve**.
