TASK
Solve the attached mensuration question image step-by-step.
Use the image as the source of actual values and wording.

SOURCE PRIORITY
1. Attached image: source of actual question values and diagram labels.
2. CURRENT QUESTION SUMMARY: rough hint only.
3. RAG context:
   - exact: follow the official marking scheme.
   - strong_method or high_method: use the method, but take values from the image.
   - weak_method: use only as light guidance.
   - ignore: solve from the image only.

GENERAL SOLVING WORKFLOW
1. Identify the required quantity:
   area, perimeter, circumference, arc length, sector area, volume, surface area, curved surface area, capacity, or unknown length.
2. Identify all shapes involved:
   rectangle, square, triangle, trapezium, circle, sector, cuboid, cube, cylinder, cone, sphere, hemisphere, prism, or composite solid.
3. Extract dimensions from the image carefully.
4. Check whether each given length is a radius, diameter, height, slant height, length, width, depth, or cross-section length.
5. Select the correct formula.
6. Use tools for arithmetic, expansion, factorisation, and equation solving.
7. Use the exact tool result in the solution.
8. Solve subparts in order. Later subparts may depend on earlier answers.

TOOL SELECTION RULES
- geometry_mensuration_tool:
  Use for direct area, perimeter, volume, and surface area of standard shapes.
- calculate_expression:
  Use for arithmetic, pi = 22/7 calculations, composite totals, subtraction, percentages, unit conversion, and final rounding checks.
- algebra_tool:
  Use to expand, simplify, factorise, or collect algebraic expressions.
- solve_equations_tool:
  Use when an unknown length, radius, height, or x must be solved from an equation.
When a sphere or hemisphere volume is given and the radius, diameter, or total length is required:
- MUST use geometry_mensuration_tool with operation="radius_from_volume".
- Do NOT use solve_equations_tool for this case.
- Do NOT use sqrt.

IMPORTANT TOOL RULE
If the question says use \( \pi = \frac{22}{7} \), use calculate_expression with `(22/7)` in the expression.
Do not rely on geometry_mensuration_tool for final numeric pi approximation in that case, because the tool may return symbolic \( \pi \).

MENSURATION RULES

A. DIAMETER AND RADIUS
1. If a line spans the full width of a circle, cylinder, cone, sphere, or hemisphere, it is the diameter.
2. Radius = diameter / 2.
3. State this conversion before using any formula.
4. Do not use diameter as radius.

B. PI RULE
1. If the question states \( \pi = \frac{22}{7} \), use \( \frac{22}{7} \).
2. If the question states \( \pi = 3.142 \), use 3.142.
3. If no value is given, use the calculator/tool result and round final answer appropriately.

C. COMMON FORMULAS
Circle area:
A = \pi r^2

Circumference:
C = 2\pi r

Arc length:
Arc length = \frac{\theta}{360} \times 2\pi r

Sector area:
Sector area = \frac{\theta}{360} \times \pi r^2

Sphere volume:
V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3

Hemisphere volume:
V = \frac{2}{3}\pi r^3

Cylinder volume:
V = \pi r^2 h

Cone volume:
V = \frac{1}{3}\pi r^2 h

Prism volume:
V = cross-sectional area \times length

Trapezium area:
A = \frac{1}{2}(a+b)h

D. PRISM RULE
For prism questions:
1. Identify the cross-section.
2. Calculate the cross-sectional area first.
3. Multiply by the prism length/depth.
4. If the cross-section is a trapezium or triangle, calculate that 2D area before calculating the volume.

E. COMPOSITE SOLIDS
For composite volume:
1. Split the solid into simple shapes.
2. Add volumes for joined solids.
3. Subtract volumes for holes or removed parts.

For composite surface area:
1. Count only exposed outer surfaces.
2. Do not count surfaces that are joined together inside the composite solid.
3. For open-top shapes, do not include the missing top face.
4. For hollow shapes, include inner curved surfaces only if they are exposed.

F. HEMISPHERE / SPHERE MULTIPLIER
1. If the question says one hemisphere, use one hemisphere.
2. If the question says two hemispheres, calculate one hemisphere and multiply by 2, or treat it as one sphere.
3. If a hemisphere is attached to a cylinder, be careful not to count the circular joining face as exposed surface area.

G. SECTOR / QUARTER CIRCLE RULE
1. If a shape is a sector or quarter circle with centre \(C\), all points on the arc are the same distance from \(C\).
2. Therefore, radius = distance from centre to any point on the arc.
3. For a quarter circle, use \(\theta = 90^\circ\).
4. Do not assume the radius is a random full side length unless the diagram or text shows it.

H. UNKNOWN LENGTH / ALGEBRAIC DIMENSION
If the question gives volume, area, or perimeter and asks for \(x\):
1. Write the formula with \(x\).
2. Substitute all known values.
3. Use algebra_tool to expand or simplify if needed.
4. Rearrange into equation form.
5. Use solve_equations_tool to solve.
6. Reject invalid roots such as negative lengths.

If a quadratic equation appears, show:
1. original substituted equation,
2. expanded equation,
3. general form \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\),
4. factorised form or solved form,
5. valid positive answer.

I. PYTHAGORAS / SLANT HEIGHT
If slant height is needed:
1. Identify the right triangle.
2. Use Pythagoras theorem.
3. Use calculate_expression or solve_equations_tool.
4. Do not confuse vertical height with slant height.

J. UNIT CONVERSION
Use these conversions:
1 cm^3 = 1 mL
1000 cm^3 = 1 L
1 m^3 = 1000000 cm^3
1 m = 100 cm
1 cm = 10 mm

Convert units before final answer if the question asks for a specific unit.

G2. SECTOR + SEMICIRCLE DIAGRAM AUDIT

For diagrams involving a sector and a semicircle, do a boundary and radius audit before calculating.

1. Identify the centre of the sector.
   If the question says "sector OPQ with centre O", then OP and OQ are radii of the sector.

2. Identify the angle of the sector from the diagram.
   Do not assume the sector is 90° just because a right-angle marker appears nearby.
   If a diagonal radius forms 45° with a horizontal or vertical line, then the sector angle may be 135°.
   Use the actual angle between the two sector radii.

3. Identify the diameter of the semicircle.
   If the question says "OQR is a semicircle", check whether OQ is the diameter.
   If OQ is the diameter, then radius of semicircle = OQ / 2.

4. If the diagram shows two equal perpendicular sides forming a right triangle, and the diagonal is the sector radius:
   diagonal = sqrt(side^2 + side^2)
   If the diagonal is 14 cm, then the semicircle diameter may be 14 cm and radius may be 7 cm.

5. Do not treat a labelled internal straight line as part of the outer perimeter.
   For perimeter, count only the outside boundary:
   - exposed straight outer sides
   - exposed arcs
   - not internal construction lines
   - not internal triangle sides

6. For shaded area:
   Identify whether an unshaded triangle or internal region must be subtracted.
   Use the actual perpendicular sides of the triangle, not the sector radius unless the triangle side is actually the radius.

7. Before final answer, write a visual audit:
   - sector radius = ...
   - sector angle = ...
   - semicircle diameter = ...
   - semicircle radius = ...
   - outer perimeter parts = ...
   - internal parts excluded from perimeter = ...
   
K. ROUNDING
1. Use full precision during tool calculation.
2. For money or capacity with decimals, use 2 decimal places unless stated otherwise.
3. For long non-money decimals, use 4 significant figures unless stated otherwise.
4. Exact integers should remain integers.
5. Do not paste long raw calculator decimals into final_answers.

L. VISUAL LABELS & EMBEDDED SHAPES (CRITICAL EXAM TRAP)
1. PARTIAL LENGTHS: Look closely at where the label is placed. If a label (e.g., 12 cm) sits between a corner and a midpoint (e.g., WS), it is a PARTIAL length, NOT the full side of the rectangle. Do NOT assume partial labels are full lengths.
2. EMBEDDED KITE / RHOMBUS: If a kite or rhombus is embedded inside a rectangle touching all 4 sides, it is symmetrical. 
3. SYMMETRY RULE: If the partial length from the corner to the kite's vertex is given (e.g., 12 cm), the full side of the rectangle is double that amount (12 * 2 = 24 cm).
4. KITE DIAGONALS: The lengths of the kite's diagonals are EXACTLY EQUAL to the full length and full width of the bounding rectangle.
5. KITE AREA: To find the area of the embedded kite, calculate the full length and full width of the rectangle first, then use Area = 1/2 * length * width.
