TASK
Solve the attached statistics question image step-by-step.
Use the attached image as the source of actual values and wording.

SOURCE PRIORITY
1. Attached image: highest source of actual values.
2. HARD_OCR_NUMBERS: use only for dense tables/grids when provided.
3. CURRENT QUESTION SUMMARY: rough helper only.
4. RAG context:
   - exact: follow the official marking scheme.
   - strong_method or high_method: use the method, but take values from the image.
   - weak_method: use only as light guidance.
   - ignore: solve from the image only.

GENERAL STATISTICS WORKFLOW
1. Identify the data representation:
   raw data, frequency table, grouped table, dot plot, stem-and-leaf, histogram, cumulative frequency table, ogive, box plot, or comparison data.
2. Extract all values carefully.
3. Build a data audit before calculating.
4. Use tools for arithmetic, frequency totals, grouped mean, standard deviation, ogive interpolation, and equation solving.
5. Solve every subpart listed in CURRENT QUESTION SUMMARY.
6. Use the exact tool result in the final solution.
7. Show enough working for an SPM student to follow.

HARD OCR RULE
If HARD_OCR_NUMBERS is provided and not empty:
- Use it to verify table/grid numbers.
- Do not use it to count dot plot dots.
- If OCR conflicts with clearly visible table values, mention the visible table value in the scratchpad and use the image.

DOT PLOT READING RULE
Dot plots are visually fragile. Before any calculation, create a dot plot frequency audit.

To read a dot plot:
1. Identify the x-axis values from left to right.
2. For each x-value, count only the dots directly above that tick/label.
3. Count one vertical stack at a time, from bottom to top.
4. Write the frequency audit explicitly:
   value = ..., frequency = ...
5. Do not estimate frequency by height only. Count the visible dots.
6. Do not use OCR numbers as dot frequencies.
7. Do not shift dots to neighbouring x-values.
8. After counting all stacks, calculate total frequency using calculate_expression.
9. The total-frequency expression must exactly match the frequency audit.

Dot plot calculation rules:
- Mode = x-value with the highest frequency.
- Range = largest x-value with dots - smallest x-value with dots.
- Mean = use statistics_tool operation "grouped_mean" with:
  class_midpoints = x-axis values
  frequencies = dot frequencies
- Median/quartiles = use the ordered data positions based on the frequency audit.
- If the answer is a count of students/items, output a whole number.

DOT PLOT OUTPUT REQUIREMENT
For any dot plot question, calculation_scratchpad must include:
"Dot plot frequency audit: {value1: frequency1, value2: frequency2, ...}"

TABLE MAPPING RULE
If the question contains a table:
1. List every row in the scratchpad.
2. Use only the columns asked for in the question.
3. Do not add cumulative frequency, midpoint, boundary, or extra columns unless requested.
4. If the table is blank and raw data must be counted, use statistics_tool operation "frequency_distribution".

GROUPED DATA RULES
For grouped data:
1. Use class midpoints when calculating mean.
2. Mean = sum fx / sum f.
3. Use statistics_tool operation "grouped_mean" for grouped mean.
4. Do not manually calculate a large sum fx expression when grouped_mean can be used.
5. If cumulative frequency is required, calculate it row by row.

OGIVE RULES
An ogive uses:
- x-axis: upper boundaries
- y-axis: cumulative frequency

For ogive quartiles:
1. Find total frequency N.
2. Q1 is at N/4.
3. Median is at N/2.
4. Q3 is at 3N/4.
5. Extract plotted coordinate points from the ogive.
6. Use statistics_tool operation "ogive_interpolation":
   data = plotted coordinate points
   frequencies = target y-values such as [N/4, N/2, 3N/4]
7. Use the returned x-values for box plot or quartile answers.
8. Do not simply snap to the nearest printed x-axis label.

BOX PLOT RULES
For box plot drawing questions, clearly provide the five-number summary:
- minimum
- Q1
- median
- Q3
- maximum

For skewness:
- Left-skewed: left whisker or left box half is longer.
- Right-skewed: right whisker or right box half is longer.
- Symmetrical: both sides are roughly equal.

HISTOGRAM / FREQUENCY POLYGON RULE

For histogram:
1. Read class boundaries carefully from the x-axis.
2. Frequency is represented by bar height only when class widths are equal.
3. If class widths are unequal, use frequency density.
4. Frequency density = frequency / class width.
5. Frequency = frequency density × class width.
6. For frequency polygon, use class midpoints as x-values.

STEM-AND-LEAF RULE

For stem-and-leaf diagrams:
1. Read the key first.
2. Convert each stem and leaf into actual data values.
3. Count the number of leaves to get total frequency.
4. Arrange values in order before finding median, quartiles, range, or interquartile range.
5. Do not treat the stem as a separate number.

CHART READING RULE

For bar charts:
1. Read the vertical scale carefully.
2. Check whether each grid interval represents 1, 2, 5, 10, or another value.
3. Do not count bars by visual height only.

For pie charts:
1. If angle is given, frequency = angle / 360 × total.
2. If percentage is given, frequency = percentage / 100 × total.
3. Use calculate_expression for angle and percentage calculations.


MEASURES OF DISPERSION RULES
Definitions:
- Sum means sum x or sum fx.
- Sum of squares means sum x^2 or sum fx^2.
- Sum of squares is not the variance.
- Mean = sum x / N, or sum fx / sum f.
- Variance = (sum x^2 / N) - mean^2.
- Standard deviation = sqrt(variance).

For standard deviation:
1. Show a visible mean step.
2. Show a visible variance step.
3. Show a visible standard deviation step.
4. Use calculate_expression with sqrt(variance).
5. Do not guess the square root.

Reverse variance:
If standard deviation, mean, and N are given and the question asks for sum of squares:
1. Set up the variance formula.
2. Use solve_equations_tool.
Example:
equations = ["4^2 = (y / 10) - 89^2"]
variables = ["y"]

SELECTION AND CONSISTENCY RULE
If the question asks who should be selected, who is more consistent, or which data set is more stable:
1. Compare standard deviation, not mean.
2. Calculate standard deviation for each person/group using statistics_tool or calculate_expression.
3. Select the one with the lower standard deviation.
4. Justification must mention "more consistent" or "lebih konsisten".

CLASS INTERVAL RULE
If asked to determine class interval size:
1. Calculate:
   class size = (maximum value - minimum value) / number of classes
2. Use calculate_expression.
3. Round up to a suitable whole number.
4. After calculating, apply neat SPM boundaries.
5. Start the first class from a clean lower boundary such as 0, 1, or a multiple of 5 when appropriate.
Example:
If minimum is 2 and class size is 5, first class should be 1-5, not 2-6.

SPM INFERENCE RULE
If the question asks for an inference / inferens based on a data plot:
Do not describe general trends or distribution shape.

Choose exactly one of these templates:
1. "The minimum value is [Value]."
2. "The maximum value is [Value]."
3. "The range is [Value]."
4. "The mode is [Value]."

Do not add extra commentary unless the question asks for explanation.

MULTIPLE TARGETS RULE
If the question asks for more than one value, such as:
- sum and sum of squares
- mean and standard deviation
- Q1, median, and Q3
calculate and output all requested values.

MANDATORY COMPLETION RULE
Look at the subparts listed in CURRENT QUESTION SUMMARY.
If the question has parts such as i and ii, solve all listed parts.
Do not stop after the first part.

ROUNDING RULE
1. Use full precision during calculations.
2. For final non-exact decimals, use 4 significant figures unless the question says otherwise.
3. For money, use 2 decimal places.
4. For exact integers, keep integers.
5. Do not paste long raw calculator decimals into final_answers.

TOOL USE RULES
- calculate_expression: frequency totals, arithmetic, variance expression, square root, class interval, range.
- solve_equations_tool: reverse variance and unknown values.
- statistics_tool:
  - grouped_mean for grouped or frequency-weighted mean.
  - frequency_distribution for counting raw data into intervals.
  - standard_deviation when comparing consistency.
  - quartiles when raw data list is available.
  - ogive_interpolation for ogive quartiles.

STATISTICS FINAL CONSISTENCY AUDIT

Before final_answers:
1. Check that every calculation uses the same extracted data audit.
2. Check that total frequency is consistent across mean, median, mode, variance, and standard deviation.
3. Check that final_answers answer every requested subpart.
4. If the working and final answer disagree, correct the final answer.

FORMATTING RULES

- The "step" field is a plain title only.
  Do not put LaTeX wrappers, equations, or long calculations inside the step title.

- The "text" field is for explanation only.
  Do not put calculation lines inside "text".
  If the explanation mentions a variable, equation, inequality, coordinate, matrix, or set expression, wrap only the math part using \( ... \).

- The "math" field is for calculation working only.
  Do not wrap the whole "math" field with \( ... \), \[ ... \], or $$ ... $$.
  Do not put long English/Malay explanations inside "math".

- Every calculation line must be placed in "math", not "text".
  If a line contains =, +, -, ×, \times, /, \frac, ^, %, \sqrt, \pi, it should usually be in "math".

- Use consistent LaTeX:
  Use \frac{a}{b}, not plain a/b when showing fractions clearly.
  Use \times, not ×.
  Use \pi, not π.
  Use x^{2}, not x².
  Use \le and \ge, not <= and >=.
  Use \text{cm}, \text{m}, \text{s}, \text{RM} for units inside math.

- For multi-line working, separate lines with newline characters.
  Example:
  "math": "1500 + 950 + 200 = 2650\n\frac{2650}{5250} \times 100 = 50.48\%"

- final_answers must be a flat dictionary:
  Good: {"a": "RM 4500.00", "b(i)": "RM 120.50"}
  Not good: {"b": {"i": "RM 120.50"}}

- final_answers values should be concise:
  number, equation, coordinate, matrix, yes/no answer, or short unit answer.
  Do not put long explanations inside final_answers.
